# Distress-Alert-System
   The objective of the project DAS is to equip the riders with a tool that will enable them to contact the helpline numbers provided by them (family members and friends) in times of an emergency. Our system is triggered by the wake word 'HELP' uttered by the rider. 
   It immediately clicks a picture of the current scenario of the interior of the vehicle from the camera mounted on the dashboard and sends it to the given helpline number both as a whatsapp message as well as an SMS, along with his car details and the location. There's a feature to record a voicemail from the rider and send it to the helpline number provided to give him/her an insight about the mishap. Along with an additional message containing the link to our site that performs a live location tracking of the vehicle in question. (uses the GPS Co-ordinates given by the Automobile databank and communicates with the site via cloud). We have also implemented Google Places API to give details of nearest emergency services (police stations, hospitals and so on) based on the car's location and display it on the map, which can then be used by the concerned person to contact the required service based on the needs.
   The data extracted from the system has also been analysed to derive meaningful insights for both the customers as well as the automobile company.
